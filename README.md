# 1. About

This repository contains implementation of Data Structures & Algorithms concepts implemented in C++.

# 2. Roadmap

- First learn C++
- Learn about the concepts given in this repository in any learning platform of your choice
- Don't spend too much time on a single topic, you will learn more on a concept by practicing problems
- After you understand the concept & you are able to implement the data structures & algorithms practice problems
- Finish the blind 75 section in neetcode https://neetcode.io/practice
- Keep on giving contests & practising in codeforces or leetcode or any other platform
